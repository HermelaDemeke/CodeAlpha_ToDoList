# To-Do List Web Application

A simple To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Add tasks to the list
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks from the list
- Tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed or the browser is closed

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/HermelaDemeke/ToDoList.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd ToDoList
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

4. You can now add, complete, and delete tasks using the web application.

## Files

- `index.html`: The HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the web application.
